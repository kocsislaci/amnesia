# Amnesia - A RIL hangover

> Step into the heart-pounding chaos of our arena slasher game, where every swing of your weapon and every dodge could mean the difference between triumph and defeat. Unleash your skills, dominate your foes, and become the ultimate champion in this relentless battle for glory.
>
> You wake up at an unknown time and place. You have no memory of who you are and what happened to you. Foes come at you, and you have to fight.

## What is this?!

Education project to experience game development with Unity. We are going to create a diablo-like slasher aRPG game. Don't worry we do not expect to solve a million-dollar problem here. We aim to experience and try our software engineering skills in something different. Hopefully by the end of our business year we can try the MVP of our game!

## How to get started?

Pull this repository and checkout to the `development` branch. There you will find the skeleton of the project.

You can open the project two ways:
* via Unity Hub you can browse the containing folder
or,
* via CLI entering the following command.
```shell
/Path/to/Unity/bin --projectPath /Path/to/project
```

Initially the project does not contain anything implemented. The only thing done is the splashscreen of the application which you can check out by building and running the app. (Don't forget, we have not implemented any feature to exit the game yet!)

## Contribution method

We are going to document our progress in Jira. The board can be reached at the following link:

[Jira board](https://rilgame.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AMN/boards/1)

We are going to follow Gitflow practice. Our production branch is `main`. At every epic we start working in a distinct branch and when finished pull to `development` branch.

Let's try and practice frequent play-testing as we design and implement a new feature! :)

Design - Implement - Test - Evaluate
